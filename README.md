# Spapros-pipeline

Warning: This pipeline is still under development and does not yet entail all steps.

This pipeline aims at providing a heavily parallelized equivalent to the [Spapros](https://github.com/theislab/spapros) package for probeset selection.    
A runnable example is provided in the run.sh script. We will provide more details and documentation as the project progresses.
